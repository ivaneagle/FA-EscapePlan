# FA Escape Plan
FA Escape Plan is a simple-to-use tool that allows you to backup your user profile and gallery from FurAffinity and store a local copy to your computer.

## Basic Usage
Enter your login credentials in the top-left to establish a connection with FA. Once your login is successful, the rest of the form will be unlocked to allow you to fine-tune the aspects of your FA account that will be backed up.

Note that this program is still under heavy development and certain features visible in the UI may not be accessible at this time.

## FAQ

### Does FA Escape Plan store my username and password?
No, your username and password are only used to login to FA to download mature and adult submissions as well as your notes. Once logged in, your session is stored in the cookie retrieved from FA and your password is immediately discarded. The session cookie is discarded upon signing out or closing the program.

### Does this work if I'm using the beta UI?
You can certainly try, however FA Escape Plan was designed and tested with the default UI in mind and it may not work properly if used when the beta UI is used. We recommend that you switch to the default UI when using FA Escape Plan.

### Will my folders be backed up as well?
At present, there is no support for folders. We are hoping to implement this in the future.
